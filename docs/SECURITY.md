## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Dependencies**: Keep all dependencies up to date
2. **Code Review**: All code changes require review
3. **Testing**: Run security tests before deployment
4. **Secrets**: Never commit secrets, API keys, or credentials
5. **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize user input

### For Users

1. **Environment Variables**: Use `.env` file for sensitive configuration
2. **HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS in production
3. **Rate Limiting**: Enable rate limiting in production
4. **Monitoring**: Monitor logs for suspicious activity
5. **Updates**: Keep the application updated to latest version

### For Deployment

1. **Container Security**: Use official base images, scan for vulnerabilities
2. **Network Security**: Use firewalls, private networks where appropriate
3. **Access Control**: Implement proper authentication and authorization
4. **Data Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
5. **Regular Audits**: Conduct regular security audits

## Known Security Considerations
